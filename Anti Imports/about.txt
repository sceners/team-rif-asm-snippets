Hello there !

Here is a small collection of Anti Imports written in ASM with MASM32.
In fact, it's easy to understand if you know a little bit the Import Table. Moreover, I coded (well, crafted :) some MACROs in order to make the use of it easier. It can fool both your debugger and you disasembler (depends of the technic). I suggest you to have a test. It also depends the tools you use, eg Olly is the only one which can pass the Anti-import1 sample.

Anti-import1  : My first one, it simply calls the functions into a variable.
Anti-import2  : This one retreive the function's address written by Windows in the IAT.
ImportHacker  : This one is cool :) It swaps two function. Have a look with IDA :)
 - normal     : The normal version, for you to understand easily.
 - discret    : The discret version, all swaps are done into a proc at the beginning. Quite lame.
TotalMassacre : It use both Importhacker and Anti-import2 technics. Easy to use (with MACROs) but total confuze for the cracker :)

PS:  Messages showed by the messageboxes are in french, but don't care, it's crap :)
PS2: It shall works fine under every OSes.
PS3: Sorry for my lame english :(

Hope ya'll have phun wit it !
